# Single SPA Microfrontends

#### Requirements:

- Node.js

#### Instructions

1. Use the "setup.bat" to install all packages and dependencies

2. Use the "start.bat" to start all servers and open up the browserpage

#### Information:

### !!! The mainpage may take a while to render everything correctly due to the servers of all frameworks that need to be started first. Check the current status of the servers in their respective terminals. !!!

### Single SPA uses Angular 8 because it doesn't support 9 yet.
